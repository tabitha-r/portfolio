                <h3>Accessibility Statement for https://www.tabithariley.digital/</h3>
                <p>This accessibility statement applies to the www.tabithariley.digitial website.</p>
                <p>This website is run by Tabitha Riley. We want this site to be accessible to as many people as possible. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>zoom in up to 500% and the text does not spill off the screen.</li>
                    <li>navigate the website using just a keyboard if required.</li>
                    <li>toggle the navigation menu with mouse hover or button click, but all information from the navigation is available without it.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>How Accessible this Website Is</h4>
                <p>Though we have strived to develop this site with extensive accessibility, we are aware that some elements of this site are not fully accessible:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The navigation menu spills off the screen when zoomed in past 150% (depending on screen size), but there is a scroll bar for this scenario.</li>
                    <li>You cannot modify line height or letter spacing of text.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Feedback and Contact</h4>

                <h4>Enforcement Procedure</h4>

                <h3>Technical Information about this Website's Accessibility</h3>
                <p>Tabitha Riley is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
                <h4>Compliance Status</h4>
                <p>This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.</p>
                <h3>Non-accessible content</h3>
                <p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>
                <h4>Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h4>
                <p>The content has not been tested in specialized browsing modes. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.1 (use of color).</p>
                <p>We plan to fully test various accessibility tools and specialized browsing modes by the end of 2021.</p>
                <h4>Disproportionate burden</h4>
                <p>The example portfolio site pages linked to this site are not WCAG 2.1 compliant as these sites were built for educational purposes and not with an intent for any sort of functional or commercial use. They will be swapped out in future for WCAG 2.1 compliant portfolio sites as they are made.</p>
                <h4>Content that's not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h4>
                <p>Does not apply.</p>
                <h3>What we're doing to improve accessibility</h3>
                <p>We are regularly testing the site in different modes, on different browsers and devices, and using different accessibility tools.</p>
